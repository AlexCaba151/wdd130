        <img src="/images/country.jpg" alt="country">
        <p>The Dominican Republic is a country on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean
        Sea, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north. Geographically, the Dominican Republic is part of the North American
        continent. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with Haiti, making Hispaniola
        one of only two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that is shared by two sovereign states. It is the
        second-largest nation in the Antilles by area (after Cuba) at 48,671 square kilometers (18,792 sq mi), and
        second-largest by population, with approximately 11.4 million people in 2024, of whom approximately 3.6 million live in
        the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital.
