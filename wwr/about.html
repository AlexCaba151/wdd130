                <h2>History</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Rafting Us was founded in 2005 by a group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts who wanted to share their love
                for whitewater rafting with others. Starting with just a few rafts and a dream, the company has grown over the years to
                become a leading provider of rafting adventures. With a focus on safety, customer satisfaction, and environmental
                stewardship, we have guided thousands of adventurers through some of the most beautiful and challenging rivers in the
                region. Our history is built on a foundation of dedication, expertise, and a deep respect for the natural world.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From our humble beginnings, we focused on three core principles: safety, customer satisfaction, and environmental 
                    stewardship. These principles have guided us as we've expanded our offerings and improved our services. Our founders 
                    believed that rafting was not just about the thrill of navigating rapids but also about fostering a deep connection with 
                    nature and promoting the importance of preserving our natural waterways.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In our early days, we offered a handful of rafting trips on local rivers. Thanks to the dedication and expertise of our 
                    team, word quickly spread about the quality and excitement of our adventures. As our reputation grew, so did our fleet and 
                    the variety of trips we could offer. We invested in state-of-the-art equipment and training for our guides, ensuring that every
                    adventure was not only exhilarating but also safe and informative.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Over the years, we have guided thousands of adventurers through some of the most beautiful and challenging rivers in the region. 
                    Our trips have taken us through lush forests, dramatic gorges, and pristine waterways, providing unforgettable experiences for our 
                    guests. We are proud of the community we have built, which includes not only our team and customers but also our partnerships with 
                    local environmental organizations and conservation efforts.
